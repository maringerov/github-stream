# GitHub Stream

A social widget for displaying a user's latest public activity on GitHub. Built with React and Webpack. WIP.

To try the widget:

```
git clone git@github.com:maringerov/github-stream.git
cd github-stream
npm install
npm start
```
This is still work in progress. You need to change the username manually in the `App` component to see results for different profiles.
